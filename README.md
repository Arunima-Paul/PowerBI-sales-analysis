Video games have evolved into one of the biggest entertainment industries worldwide. 
By analyzing global sales trends, genre popularity, and top-selling games, we can uncover valuable insights into market dynamics. 
Let’s dive into the key findings from our Power BI dashboard.

•	Wii Sports dominates with 81M+ copies sold, far ahead of other games.
•	Nintendo titles such as Super Mario Bros., Tetris, and Mario Kart Wii also rank among the best-sellers.
•	The Call of Duty franchise appears twice, highlighting the success of FPS games.

iii) Sales Trends Over Time- The gaming industry has seen rapid growth, with noticeable spikes in sales around 2000–2010. 
However, there is a drop in sales after 2010, possibly due to changing consumer preferences.

•	Role-Playing and Racing genres are also quite popular.
•	Puzzle and Strategy games have the lowest sales, indicating niche audiences.

v) Through trend analysis and regional sales breakdowns, we can uncover valuable insights into how the industry has transformed over time.
•	The number of gaming genres has steadily increased from the 1980s to the early 2010s, reaching a peak before a decline.
•	The industry witnessed a boom in genre diversity from the 1990s to 2010, likely due to advancements in gaming technology and player preferences evolving.
•	However, as per the dataset, after 2010 there's a decline in genre variety, which could indicate consolidation around popular genres or shifting industry trends towards digital gaming models.
The sharp drop suggests a shift from traditional gaming consoles to digital and cloud-based gaming, such as PlayStation, Xbox, and PC has likely led to the phasing out of smaller or less competitive platforms.

vi) Regional Preferences: While in Europe, North America and Rest of World Racing & Sports games dominate , in Japan niche games like Platform & Puzzle games dominate with 19.32 Million sales.
•	Action, Adventure, Fighting, and Shooter games also hold a significant share, but much lower than sports games.

viii) The Correlation Between Global Sales & Reviews-
